            Rini scores credit applications and loans using diverse alternative data sources, 
            from rental and utility payments to asset ownership and public records. Itâ€™s like having a 
            crystal ball as it zeroes in on high-risk assets and anticipates loan repayments. Streamline 
            your operations with an automated pre-approval system for incoming applications and fine-tune 
            your credit portfolio risk.
